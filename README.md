## 4. Installation
### 4.1 Preparing the disk
> You want to use a high quality DVD-R __(Not a DVD+R, CD-R, etc.)__

1. Use a CD Burner software to write the ISO onto the disk. Use following settings:
  - **Writing Speed:** 1x (max. 5x)
  - **Verify cycles:** As many as possible (I would recommend at least doing 3)

### 4.2 Installing it on the RNS
> Do not install with activated ignition or running engine. Just don't put the key in.
> Connect the battery to an battery charger to ensure no power loss
> Do not try to pause or stop the update

> #### Specifications
> **Time needed:** 25-90 minutes
> The device will turn off a few times for a couple of minutes multible times. It's best if you'll leave while it's installing

1. Turn on the RNS
2. Insert the disk
3. If it doesn't start automaticly use the following combination: SETUP + ★ + ⏏ on some devices it's SETUP + INFO + ⏏
4. Follow the instructions
5. Remove the DVD afterwards
